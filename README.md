ChangeBackgroundbyTime
======================

This will change the color of the background and the text according to the hour presented by the computer.  Idea is bright backgrounds for day and darker ones for night.  

Feel free to add/subtract (although there isn't much to take away) to this.  This was just something I wanted to do to get off my tail and start writing some code.  Thanks, MT
